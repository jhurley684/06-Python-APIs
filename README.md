# API_Challenge
This challenge was in two parts.  In the first part (weatherpy_assignment.ipynb) weather data was visualized for 500+
cities across the world.  Through plotting some correlation graphs and then running linear regression analysis
some observations were made about how strong some of the correlations were.

In the next part (vacationPy.ipynb) we used weather data ouput from the WeatherPy exercise.  From the weather data in 
WeatherPY, areas of high humidity levels around the world were identified via heatmaps.  The weather data was then narrowed
to in order to identify a handful of places in the world that were to personal weather preferences - in this case high 
temperatures with high humidity, ostenibly for vacationing in.  Finally, Google Places API data was utilized to locate 
hotels within each of the optimal vaction spots.  A map combing the humidity heatmap with hotel locations was created for
the vacationer's convenience.
